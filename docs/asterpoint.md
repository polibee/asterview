E. Au Points Calculation
We take hourly snapshots to calculate Au points. Check your Au points on the S1 Landing Page. There is an hourly cap of 100M Au points per address in Stage 1 (Does not include team boost and ref bonus).

The formula for calculating Au points is:

Au = SUM( holding_token_USD_value * token_AU_multiplier ) * (team boost + Trader boost) + ref bonus

Au is the total airdrop points you get from minting and holding assets

holding_token_USD_value refers to the USD investment of your underlying asset. For example, if you stake 0.5 BNB when BNB price is $670, your holding_token_USD_value is 0.5 x 670.

token_AU_multiplier is the Au multiplier of the asset. For example, asBNB has a 5x Au multiplier.

team boost is the boost leverage of your team.

Trader Boost is the additional Au boost you earn from trading on Aster Pro mode. 

ref bonus is the total Au points you have earned from your Tier 1 and 2 referrals.

Scenario:

If you stake 0.5 BNB when BNB price is $670, and asBNB Au multiplier is 5x, your mint earns (0.5 x 670 x 5) = 1,675 Au. 

If there is no change in BNB price, you will continue earning (0.5 x 670 x 5) Au per hour.

If BNB price later drops to $650, you will earn (0.5 x 650 x 5) Au per hour.

To calculate your Pro mode trading volume, use this formula:
Pro taker volume + (Pro maker volume*0.5)

For example, Alice conducted trades on Aster Pro on Monday, reaching a total trading volume of 50k. On Tuesday 00:00 UTC+0, the system calculates Alice's Pro mode trading volume and verifies that it corresponds to an Au Trader Boost of 2x. This boost will be reflected in Alice's airdrop dashboard and Alice receives an additional 2x boost on her Au points at 00:05 UTC+0 on Tuesday.

C. Au Points Calculation
The formula for calculating Au points is:

Au = SUM( holding_token_USD_value * token_AU_multiplier ) * (team boost + Trader boost) + ref bonus

Au is the total airdrop points you get from minting and holding assets

holding_token_USD_value refers to the USD investment of your underlying asset. For example, if you stake 0.5 BNB when BNB price is $670, your holding_token_USD_value is 0.5 x 670.

token_AU_multiplier is the Au multiplier of the asset. For example, asBNB has a 5x Au multiplier.

team boost is the boost leverage of your team.

Trader Boost is the additional Au boost you earn from trading on Aster Pro mode. 

ref bonus is the total Au points you have earned from your Tier 1 and 2 referrals.

2. Rh Points Calculation
3. FAQ 
4. Terms & Conditions

In the Trade like a Pro, Earn like a Pro program, earn Rh points in each weekly epoch when you trade perpetuals on Aster Pro Mode. Refer friends, form teams and boost Rh! 

Only trades on Aster Pro Mode via the Aster website earn Rh points.

You may qualify for extra rewards: 1.1x Rh points boost AND/OR 100 BonusUSD trading bonus. Remember to claim them before trading.

1. Why Pro Mode?
Pro mode introduces an advanced order book interface with deep liquidity, up to 100x leverage and advanced trading tools. It doesnâ€™t just provide a CEX-like experience; Pro modeâ€™s fees are even lower than CEXs!

Fees: Maker 0.01%, Taker 0.035% 

Multi-assets mode: Trade perps using different cryptocurrency assets as collateral

Referral program: 20% commission, with a tiered system in the works

Airdrop points: Trading on Pro mode earn you Rh points for the upcoming $AST airdrop

2. Rh Points Calculation
An epoch lasts one week, from Monday 00:00 UTC+0 to Sunday 23:59 UTC+0. Only the first epoch differs: Wednesday, 10 Apr. to Sunday, 13 Apr. 23:59 UTC+0.

Only trades on Aster Pro mode via the Aster website earn Rh points. Trades on Aster Simple mode (onchain trading) and Dumb Mode do not earn Rh points. Your Rh balance updates every hour. Unlike Au, Rh points do not stack hourly.

Formula:
Rh = [Pro taker_vol + (Pro maker_vol*0.5)]*(team boost + user_Rh_boost) + ref bonus

For example:

If Aliceâ€™s taker_vol is $100, maker_vol is $200, and Alice has no team boost, Aliceâ€™s Rh = [100 + (200*0.5)] = 200 Rh

If Aliceâ€™s taker_vol is $100, maker_vol is $200, and Alice has a team boost of 1.1x, Aliceâ€™s Rh = [100 + (200*0.5)]*(1.1) = 220 Rh

Note: Each trading pair has a minimum trading order size. Depending on the leverage selected, you will need a corresponding minimum principal. Please choose your leverage accordingly.



Your airdrop allocation from Rh points is determined by your Rh weightage in each epoch:
Your Rh weightage = sum(your total Rh in this epoch / all Rh in this epoch)

Scenario:

Alice invites Ben. Ben binds Aliceâ€™s invite code.

Ben earns 5,000 Au from his first mint.

Alice earns 10% of Benâ€™s points. Thus, she gets 5,000*0.1 = 500 Au.

Ben invites Charlie to Aster. Charlie binds Benâ€™s invite code.

Charlie earns 2,500 Au from his first mint.

Ben earns 10% of Charlieâ€™s points. Thus, he gets 2,500*0.1 = 250 Au.

Alice earns 5% of Charlieâ€™s points. Thus, she gets 2,500*0.05 = 125 Au.


3b. Au Team Boost
Everyone in a referral family is a Team. Teams can enjoy team boosts. A team is composed of the following members:

The person who invited you (A)

Other invitees of the person who invited you (B)

Yourself (C)

Your invitees (D)

For example, Alice invited you and Don to Aster. You invited Charlie. Charlie invited Evan. Hence, Alice is A. Don is B. You are C. Charlie is D. Evan is not included in your Team.

Team Boost Scenario:
Team boosts are applied to the teamâ€™s cumulative Au from minting asTokens, USDF and ALP only in the previous hour. Hourly snapshots are taken to calculate Team Au points. Au earned from referral bonuses or previous team boosts are not included in the total Au amount.

For example:

Alice, Ben and Don are a team. In the previous hour, Alice earned 500,000 Au, Ben earned 300,000 Au and Don earned 200,000 Au. These Au points are earned from minting asTokens, USDF and ALP only. Au earned from their referral bonuses or previous team boosts are not counted.

Team Au in the previous hour
= 500,000 + 300,000 + 200,000
= 1,000,000 Au

According to the table below, all members benefit from a 1.05x team boost.

Alice gets 500,000*1.05 = 525,000 Au.
Ben gets 300,000*1.05 = 315,000 Au.
Dion gets 200,000*1.05 = 210,000 Au.

Scenario:

Wyn invites Yuki to trade on Aster Pro Mode. Yuki binds Wynâ€™s invite code.

Yuki trades 5,000 USD volume. She earns 5,000 Rh.

Wyn earns 10% of Yukiâ€™s points. Thus, she gets 5,000*0.1 = 500 Rh.

Yuki invites Zen to trade on Aster Pro Mode. Zen binds Yukiâ€™s invite code.

Zen trades 2,000 USD volume. Zen earns 2,000 Rh.

Yuki earns 10% of Zenâ€™s points. Thus, she gets 2,000*0.1 = 200 Rh.

Wyn earns 5% of Zenâ€™s points. Thus, she gets 2,000*0.05 = 100 Rh.


4b. Rh Team Boost
Everyone in a referral family is a Team. Teams can enjoy team boosts. A team is composed of the following members:

The person who invited you (A)

Other invitees of the person who invited you (B)

Yourself (C )

Your invitees (D)

For example, Yuki invited you and Wyn to Aster. You invited Zen. Zen invited Ben. Hence, Yuki is A. Wyn is B. You are C. Zen is D. Ben is not included in your Team.

Team Boost Scenario:
Team boosts are applied to the teamâ€™s cumulative Rh from trading in the previous day. Daily snapshots are taken to calculate Team Rh points. Rh earned from referral bonuses or previous team boosts are not included in the total Rh amount.

For example:

Wyn, Yuki and Zen are a team. In the previous day, Wyn earned 600,000 Rh, Yuki earned 300,000 Rh and Zen earned 100,000 Rh. These Rh are earned from trading on Aster Pro Mode only. Rh earned from their referral bonuses or previous team boosts are not counted.

Team Rh in the previous day

= 600,000 + 300,000 + 100,000
= 1,000,000 Rh

According to the table below all members benefit from a 1.05x team boost.

Wyn gets 600,000*1.05 = 630,000 Rh.

Yuki gets 300,000*1.05 = 315,000 Rh.

Zen gets 100,000*1.05 = 105,000 Rh.
